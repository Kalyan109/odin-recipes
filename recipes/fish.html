    <p><em>Giving homemade food to your cat from time to time is a pleasurable experience for both you and your feline. Fresh fish especially replicates their natural diet in the wild and the cat will find it particularly appetizing.</em></p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> it is recommended to feed cats cooked fish rather than raw fish. Cooking the fish helps eliminate potential parasites and reduce the risk of bacterial contamination, such as salmonella or listeria. Ensure that the fish is thoroughly cooked, without any seasonings, spices, or added ingredients that may be harmful to cats.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>500 g fish (such as tuna or salmon)</li>
        <li>100 g peeled shrimp and mussels</li>
        <li>100 g pumpkin</li>
        <li>A little bit of brewer's yeast</li>
        <li>Two eggs</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>How to cook?</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Cut the pumpkin into small chunks and boil in unsalted water</li>
        <li>Boil two eggs in a separate saucepan and crush them up once they are cooked. Include the shell, as this is ideal for extra calcium intake. You should pulverize the shell until it is a small as possible.</li>
        <li>Cook the prawns and mussels for a short time in a non-stick pan, without using any oil.</li>
        <li>Cook the fish the same way and cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>Mix all the ingredients together: the diced fish, prawns, mussels, boiled pumpkin and the chopped eggs. Use your hands to help mix it all together.</li>

    </ol></p>
    <p>Once the homemade fish recipe for cats is complete, you'll be able to store it in the freezer in Tupperware or plastic bags. This recipe will give you enough to last around 4 days for an average size cat. However, this will depend on factors such as their nutritional needs, weight and general health status.</p>
